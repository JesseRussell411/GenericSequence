    <Description>Represents a generic immutable sequence of T. Equality is, like strings, based on value not reference.

It's essencially a wrapper for immutableArray, but with value based equality instead of reference based equality. For example: (5,2,2,4) equals (5,2,2,4) even if the reference is not the same, and (3,2) obviously doesn't equal (5,4,6); this example is working with Sequences of type: Sequence.

The hashcode is generated by combining the hashcodes of all the elements in the set, with default(int) being the hashcode for an empty set.</Description>
